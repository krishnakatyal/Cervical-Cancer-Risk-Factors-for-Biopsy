# Cervical-Cancer-Risk-Factors-for-Biopsy
Cervical cancer occurs when the cells of the cervix grow abnormally and invade other tissues and organs of the body. When it is invasive, this cancer affects the deeper tissues of the cervix and may have spread to other parts of the body (metastasis), most notably the lungs, liver, bladder, vagina, and Rectum.
each year cervical cancer kills about 300,000 women worldwide.
